This project is the continue of the third assignment of the Pacman game. 
As same as the third project the pacman eats the fruit on the screen, however in this project, we added to the original's pacmans and their fruit, ghosts, black boxes and a player. 
In this project the player need to beat the pacmam and get to the fruits before the pacman to earn more points. 
Another way the player can get more points is if he eats the pacman. the player needs to do all the things above while being careful not to get eaten by the ghost and not enter the black boxes or he'll lose points.
The user chooses a csv file that have the object play coordination and initial position to the player.

After this we have two options for the game:
1.	automatic play- uses the algorithm we create using "Djisktra" and graph_v0.11jar
2.	user play- the play move by clicking the mouse on the screen board.
