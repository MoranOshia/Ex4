# Ex4

this project is the countinue of the third assigment of the Pacman game.
As same as the third project the pacman eats the fruit on the screen, but in this project we added to the original's pacmans and thier fruit, ghosts, black boxes and a player.
In this project the player as to beat the pacmam and get to the fruits before the pacman and earn more ponts, another way the player can get more ponits is if he eats the pacman.
the player need to do all the things above while being careful not to get eaten by the ghost and not enter the balck boxes or he'll lose points.
The user choose a csv file that have the object play coordination and init location to the player. 

After this we have two options for the game: 
1. automatic play- uses the algorithm we create using "Djisktra" and graph_v0.11jar 
2. user play- the play move by clicking the mouse on the screen board.
